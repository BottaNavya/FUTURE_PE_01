## AI-Powered Multi-Page Café Website System – “BrewNest Cafe”

This repository contains my submission for Task 1 of the Prompt Engineering Internship at Future Interns.

The objective of this project was to demonstrate how structured prompt engineering can be used to generate, refine, and optimize a complete multi-page website for a local business.

## 📌 Project Overview

For this task, I designed and developed a multi-page café website named **“BrewNest Cafe”**, based in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh.

Instead of manually writing every section from scratch, I used a structured prompt framework to:

* Generate multi-page website architecture
* Create conversion-focused homepage copy
* Build categorized menu content
* Develop persuasive call-to-action sections
* Improve UI spacing and responsiveness
* Optimize layout hierarchy and SEO structure

The goal was not just building a website — but improving output quality through better prompt design.

## 🧠 Prompt Engineering Strategy

I followed an iterative refinement workflow:

1. Defined business context (location, audience, tone, positioning)
2. Generated structured multi-page layout
3. Added clear technical constraints (responsive design, semantic HTML, Tailwind CSS)
4. Refined messaging for stronger value proposition and CTAs
5. Improved UI consistency, spacing, and visual hierarchy
6. Optimized SEO structure (meta tags, headings, keyword integration)

This process demonstrates how structured prompting directly improves:

* Technical accuracy
* UI consistency
* Conversion quality
* Business readiness
